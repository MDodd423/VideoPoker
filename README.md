# VideoPoker

Video Poker is a minimal Android application featuring visual gameplay without core poker logic. The app uses Compound Drawables to display the poker cards and uses dataBinding to manage the UI elements.

This example is now available in both Java and Kotlin. Edit the Android Manifest and layout file to switch between versions.
